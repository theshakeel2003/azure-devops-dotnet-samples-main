# Client library sample snippets

This project contains C# samples that show how to integrate with Azure DevOps using the [public client libraries](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/nugetvss). Most samples are short snippets that call just a single REST API.

You can use these snippets to jumpstart your own apps and services.

## Explore

Samples are organized by "area" (service) and "resource". Each sample class shows various ways for interacting with Azure DevOps.

## Run the samples

1. Clone this repository.

2. Build the solution using .NET Core 3.1 or later.

3. Run `dotnet run --project ClientSamples.netcore.csproj` with the required arguments:
   * `/url:{value}`: URL of the account/collection to run the samples against.
   * `/area:{value}`: API area (work, wit, notification, git, core, build) to run the client samples for. Use * to include all areas. Be sure to escape the * if you're on a Unix.
   * `/resource:{value}`: API resource to run the client samples for. Use * to include all resources. Be sure to escape the * if you're on a Unix.

> **IMPORTANT**: some samples are destructive. It is recommended that you run these samples against a test account.

## Run the samples - .NET Framework

1. Clone this repository and open in Visual Studio (2015 or later)

2. Build the solution (you may need to restore the required NuGet packages first)

3. Run `Microsoft.Azure.DevOps.ClientSamples.exe` with the required arguments:
   * `/url:{value}`: URL of the account/collection to run the samples against.
   * `/area:{value}`: API area (work, wit, notification, git, core, build) to run the client samples for. Use * to include all areas.
   * `/resource:{value}`: API resource to run the client samples for. Use * to include all resources.

> **IMPORTANT**: some samples are destructive. It is recommended that you run these samples against a test account.

### Examples of how to run different samples

#### Run all samples

```
Microsoft.Azure.DevOps.ClientSamples.exe
    /url:https://dev.azure.com/fabrikam /area:* /resource:*
```

#### Run all work item tracking samples

```
Microsoft.Azure.DevOps.ClientSamples.exe
    /url:https://dev.azure.com/fabrikam /area:wit /resource:*
```

#### Run all graph samples

```
Microsoft.Azure.DevOps.ClientSamples.exe
    /url:https://dev.azure.com/fabrikam /area:graph /resource:*
```

#### Run all Git pull request samples

```
Microsoft.Azure.DevOps.ClientSamples.exe
    /url:https://dev.azure.com/fabrikam /area:git /resource:pullrequests
```

#### Run all samples against an on-premises TFS project collection

```
Microsoft.Azure.DevOps.ClientSamples.exe
    /url:https://mytfs:8080/tfs/testcollection /area:git /resource:*
```

### Save request and response data to a JSON file

To persist the HTTP request/response as JSON for each client sample method that is run, set the `/outputPath:{value}` argument. For example:

```
Microsoft.Azure.DevOps.ClientSamples.exe
    /url:https://dev.azure.com/fabrikam /area:* /resource:* /outputPath:c:\temp\http-output
```

This creates a folder for each area, a folder for each resource under the area folder, and a file for each client sample method that was run. The name of the JSON file is determined by the name of the client sample method. For example:

```
|-- temp
    |-- http-output
        |-- Notification
            |-- EventTypes
                |-- ...
            |-- Subscriptions
                |-- CreateSubscriptionForUser.json
                |-- QuerySubscriptionsByEventType.json
                |-- ...
```

Note: certain HTTP headers like `Authorization` are removed for security/privacy purposes.
